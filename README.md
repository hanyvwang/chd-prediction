This dataset was originally compiled in 1988 and comprises four distinct cohorts collected from Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach.

The full dataset contains 76 variables, including the outcome variable. However, consistent with prior published studies, the present analysis utilizes a subset of 14 commonly used attributes, which are standard in the heart disease prediction literature.

The outcome variable is a binary indicator of heart disease status:

`0` — absence of heart disease

`1` — presence of heart disease
